# Scorecard Node - Correct Inputs Guide

## Input Port 1: Coefficients (from Logistic Regression Node)
- Should be Output 2 from the Logistic Regression node
- Contains model coefficients
- Format: Row ID = variable name, Column = coefficient value
- Example rows:
  - (Intercept): -2.5
  - WOE_Age: 0.8
  - WOE_Income: 1.2

## Input Port 2: Bins (from WOE Editor Node) *** IMPORTANT ***
- Should be Output 4 from the WOE Editor node (NOT Output 2 or 3!)
- Contains BINNING RULES, not data with WOE values
- Typical size: 5-20 bins per variable
- Required columns: var, bin, binValue, woe

### What NOT to use:
❌ Output 2 (df_with_woe) - This is your original data with WOE columns
❌ Output 3 (df_only_woe) - This is your data with only WOE columns
✅ Output 4 (bins) - This is the BINNING RULES table

### How to check if you have the right input:
1. Look at the row count
   - CORRECT: 50-200 rows (a few bins per variable)
   - WRONG: Thousands or millions of rows (this is your data, not bins!)

2. Look at the 'var' column
   - CORRECT: Each variable appears 5-20 times
   - WRONG: Each variable appears thousands of times

## Note on Processing Time:
The Scorecard node will process ALL interactions, regardless of size.
- Small interactions (10 × 10 = 100 combinations): Instant
- Medium interactions (50 × 50 = 2,500 combinations): Seconds
- Large interactions (100 × 100 = 10,000 combinations): May take longer

The node will show progress in the console:
"INFO: Interaction var1_x_var2 will create 10,000 combinations"
"This may take some time to process..."

## Best Practice:
Use the WOE Editor's MAX_BINS setting to control bin counts BEFORE creating the scorecard.
This prevents excessive combinations at the source.
